# Pr0Ca1
Pr0Ca1 is a programmer's calculator for Android 4.4 KitKat.

During the Fall 2017 semester at Blackburn College, myself and nine other students in the CS320 Software Engineering class developed the original Pr0Ca1 for Android 8.0 as our semester project. Since then, I have worked on porting Pr0Ca1 over to Android 4.4 KitKat so that it will be compatible with older devices.
