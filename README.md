## Contributers
During the Fall 2017 semester at Blackburn College, myself and nine other students in the CS320 Software Engineering class developed a programmer's calculator for Android 8.0 as our semester project. Pr0Ca1 as it exists today would not have been possible without the work of those talented people.
